# Generative AI: Building RAG-Model using Orwells 1984

This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to constructing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models using the classic novel “1984” by George Orwell as the knowledge base. Leveraging the capabilities of LangChain, the tutorial walks through the process of installing dependencies, preprocessing the text, and implementing the RAG model to answer questions about the novel. The README will highlight the seamless integration of AI and literature, showcasing how generative models can enhance our understanding and interaction with classic texts.
