# Generative AI: Building RAG-Model using Orwells 1984

## Overview
Welcome to our project! In this tutorial, we delve into the fascinating world of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models. Our goal? To construct an intelligent system that combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative approaches. And what better way to explore this than by using George Orwell’s iconic novel, “1984,” as our knowledge base?

## Purpose
Enhancing Text Understanding: We believe that AI can deepen our understanding of classic literature. By building RAG models, we aim to extract relevant information from a large corpus of text and generate insightful answers to user queries.
Seamless Integration of AI and Literature: Imagine having an AI companion that not only comprehends literary works but also engages in meaningful conversations about them. Our project bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and timeless literature.

## Key Steps
* Installation and Setup: We guide you through installing the necessary dependencies and setting up your environment.
* Data Preprocessing: We preprocess the text of “1984,” splitting it into chapters and preparing it for further analysis.
* Document Retrieval: Using a FAISS index, we retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
* Answer Generation: Our RAG model generates answers by combining retrieved information with creative language generation.

## Why “1984”?
George Orwell’s dystopian masterpiece is rich in themes, symbolism, and thought-provoking ideas. By building RAG models around it, we unlock new ways to explore literature and engage with its content.

Let’s dive in!
